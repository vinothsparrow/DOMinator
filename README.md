DOMinator is a powerful Chrome extension designed to assist developers and security professionals in testing and identifying DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities on websites. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for dynamically analyzing and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages to uncover potential security weaknesses. With DOMinator, users can simulate various attack scenarios, inject payloads, and observe how the DOM reacts, enabling them to pinpoint vulnerable areas and strengthen the overall security posture of web applications.
